In this project we will be implementing a neural network to classify MNIST digits.

part2-nn/neural_nets.py in which I will implement my first neural net from scratch
part2-mnist/nnet_fc.py where I will start using PyTorch to classify MNIST digits
part2-mnist/nnet_conv.py where I will use convolutional layers to boost performance
part2-twodigit/mlp.py and part2-twodigit/conv.py which are for a new, more difficult version of the MNIST dataset
